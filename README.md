Arbitrary function models references to the Twin Network and Extended Network being applied onto the mathematical functions. 
Black_Scholes_Models refrecnes to the Twin Network and Extended Network being applied onto the black scholes call option. 

New_models is all the models that was considered for the disertation and the project. 
Old_models is not included in the disertation report. 

   1.Method1a : Twin Network. 
   2.Method2 : Extended Twin Network.
   3.Arbitrary function models : Mathematical functions being tested by method1a and method 2. 
   4.Black_Scholes_Model : Black Scholes models holding adjusted and non-adjusted tests. 
   5.BS_no_change : no adjustments to d1 and d2 
   6.BS_adj_d1d2 : adjusted d1 and $d_{2. 
   7.Norm : Models with normalized data. 
   8.Unorm : Models with not normalised data (Unnormalised). 
   9.Quadratic layers : quadratic layers in the architectures. 
   10.New Models : is the models that is used in this dissertation and referenced to the experiments
   11. Old Models : is models and work implemented that is not mentioned in the report and the results.
