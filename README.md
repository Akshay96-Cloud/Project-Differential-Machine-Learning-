Arbitrary function models references to the Twin Network and Extended Network being applied onto the mathematical functions. 
Black_Scholes_Models refrecnes to the Twin Network and Extended Network being applied onto the black scholes call option. 

New_models is all the models that was considered for the disertation and the project. 
Old_models is not included in the disertation report. 

   Method1a : Twin Network. 
   Method2 : Extended Twin Network. 
   Arbitrary function models : Mathematical functions being tested by method1a and method 2. 
   Black\_Scholes\_Model : Black Scholes models holding adjusted and non-adjusted tests. 
   BS\_no\_change : no adjustments to $d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$. 
   BS\_adj\_d1d2 : adjusted $d_{1}$ and $d_{2}$. 
   Norm : Models with normalized data. 
   Unorm : Models with not normalised data (Unnormalised). 
   Quadratic layers : quadratic layers in the architectures. 
   New Models : is the models that is used in this dissertation and referenced to the experiments
   Old Models : is models and work implemented that is not mentioned in the report and the results.
